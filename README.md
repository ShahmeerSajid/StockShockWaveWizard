# StockShockWaveWizard
Ever wonder where your favorite stocks might be heading in the next 10 days? This project is here to help you figure that out! We’ve built a tool that predicts the Adjusted Close prices of any stock, using a powerful combination of traditional methods like ARIMA and modern techniques like LSTM neural networks. The best part? It pulls in real-time data straight from Yahoo Finance, so you’re always working with the latest information.
